I will use this readme to describe how I attempted to solve every problem and the stuff I went through to finish it. I started late (on the 19th) so im just going to take my time going through all of the problems for this year.

Day 1: 
    This wasn't too bad of a puzzle when it came to the thought process behind it, iterate through the list and through each item beyond it, the tricky part for me was doing it in python as it had been a little bit of time since I had worked explicitly with it. Day 2 introduced a problem with my design in day one that could make it better to modularize it, allowing for a sum of any number of numbers adding up to an amount but for now I'll allow it to sit as is with 2 and three.

Day 2:
    This day was a little harder, working with split as well now. This advent will definitely sharpen my python skills. The first part im perfectly fine with how I did it but I feel that for part 2 I could more efficiently organise my logic overall when checking to see if a password is valid
